# NPE-PFN: Effortless, Simulation-Efficient Bayesian Inference using Tabular Foundation Models

This is a minimal repository implementing NPE-PFN, a method for simulation-based inference using tabular foundation models, together with its sequential variant TSNPE-PFN. See the associated [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17660).

In this implementation, [TabPFNv2](https://github.com/PriorLabs/TabPFN) is used as the tabular foundation model.

**NOTE:** This repository is under active development. In the future, the NPE-PFN interface will be aligned with the one used in the [`sbi`](https://github.com/sbi-dev/sbi) package. Expect rough edges and breaking changes.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install with pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mackelab/npe-pfn
cd npe-pfn
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from npe_pfn import TabPFN_Based_NPE_PFN

prior = ... # torch distribution
simulator = ... # callable
x_o = ... # observation

num_simulations = 1000
thetas = prior.sample((num_simulations,))
xs = simulator(thetas)

posterior_estimator = TabPFN_Based_NPE_PFN(prior=prior)
posterior_estimator.append_simulations(thetas, xs)

# NO TRAINING!

num_posterior_samples = 10_000
posterior_samples = posterior_estimator.sample((num_posterior_samples,), x=x_o)
```

See `demo.ipynb` for detailed usage examples of both NPE-PFN and TSNPE-PFN.

## Testing

Some minimal tests are provided. To run them, make sure you have `pytest` installed. Then use the following command:
```bash
pytest --log-cli-level=INFO tests
```
These tests include timings of the autoregressive and ratio-based log probs.

Some tests should only be run when a GPU is available.
To run fast, CPU-friendly tests, use
```bash
pytest -m fast --log-cli-level=INFO tests
```
